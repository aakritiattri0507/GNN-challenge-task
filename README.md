# GNN Challenge: Drug–Target Interaction Classification (Davis Dataset)

## 📌 Problem Definition
This challenge focuses on **binary classification of drug–target interactions (DTIs)** using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**.  
Given a drug molecule graph and a protein target graph, the goal is to predict whether the interaction is **strong or weak**.

This problem is covered under **DGL Lectures 1.1–4.6**, including:
- Message passing neural networks
- Graph-level classification
- Neighborhood aggregation
- Sampling and batching of graph data
- Imbalanced classification handling

## 🧠 Problem Type
- **Graph Classification**
- **Binary Classification**

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Dataset**: Davis Drug–Target Interaction Dataset
- **Source**: Public benchmark dataset used in DeepDTA and GraphDTA
- **Description**:
  - Drugs represented as molecular graphs
  - Targets represented as protein graphs
  - Continuous binding affinity values converted to binary labels

**Label Construction**:
- Strong interaction: KIBA/Davis score ≥ threshold
- Weak interaction: KIBA/Davis score < threshold

---

## 🎯 Objective Metric
The primary evaluation metric is:

- **F1-score (macro)**

This metric is chosen because:
- The dataset is **class-imbalanced**
- Accuracy is misleading in this setting
- F1-score is difficult to optimize and more informative

Secondary metrics:
- Precision
- Recall
- ROC-AUC

---

## ⚙️ Constraints
- No external datasets allowed
- Must use only the Davis dataset
- Model must train within **reasonable time on a single GPU or CPU**
- Only methods covered in **DGL Lectures 1.1–4.6** may be used
